Would you like your intrusive thoughts to win for once? If your answer is yes, welcome aboard, Chaos in Train! The game's main goal is pranking the old men on the train. You can use two prank tools to pass the levels; a banana and a glue. With a banana, you can analyze how old men walk and put a banana in front of them to make them fall and go away. With glue, you can put some glue on one of the seats to make them angry and go away. At each station, there will be two old men getting on the train. As every station goes by, your level increases. You have three hearts which means you can only make mistakes three times before you fail. If old men sit on a seat that is not pranked, you lose one heart. If you lose three hearts, the game is over. Try the maximize your score by passing the levels and competing with other players!
